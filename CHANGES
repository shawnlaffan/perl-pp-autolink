Revision history for App::PP::Autolink

2.12 20231028
  - Stop adding ./lib to @INC before scanning.
    It was causing substantial slowdowns on Windows.

2.11 20230517
  - Handle absolute paths under Strawberry Perl 5.36. GH#19

2.10 20221126
  - Non-windows: Copy pp_autolink.pl to pp_autolink at build time
    so the docs match.  An imperfect approach but works for now.  

2.09 20221119
  - add hashbang line to pp_autolink.pl for EUMM to update on install 

2.08 20221119
  - Set the minimum perl version to 5.14 so we can use s///r.
    We can revisit if earlier versions are shown to be needed.

2.07 20221115
  - Add detected Aliens to the pp call if they inherit from Alien::Base.
    Needed to ensure the share dirs are packed (see Module::ScanDeps#13).

2.06 20221115
  - Macs: Handle @rpath and @loader_path entries in dependency paths. GH#17

2.05 20220919
  - Unices: Pack system libs, except for libm, libc, libpthread and libdl
      The previous approach overdid things.
      Thanks @sciurius for the report.  

2.04 20200622
  - Properly exclude system libs in /lib/ when using ldd.

2.03 20200612
